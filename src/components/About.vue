                As a dedicated Front End Developer with almost three years of
                experience, I specialize in crafting dynamic and user-friendly
                web applications using Vue.js. My expertise lies primarily in
                Vue 3, where I leverage the power of JavaScript and TypeScript
                to build robust and scalable applications.

                I have a solid foundation in integrating back-end services and
                managing databases, with practical experience using Prisma,
                MongoDB, and Firebase. My proficiency extends to UI frameworks
                and design systems, particularly Quasar and Tailwind CSS,
                ensuring the creation of visually appealing and highly
                responsive user interfaces.

                Collaboration and version control are second nature to me, with
                Git being an essential part of my workflow. I thrive in
                fast-paced environments, continuously improving my skills and
                staying updated with the latest industry trends and
                technologies.
